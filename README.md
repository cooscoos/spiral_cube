# Spiral to Cube

Here's some code to convert spiral coordinates for a hexagon grid to cube coordinates (q,r,s) and vice versa.

* The main code is written in Rust. Use cargo run.
* spiral_to_cube_demo.ipynb shows some of the maths behind how this is done in a visual way, and how you might go about this in Python.
