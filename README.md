# Spiral to Cube

Here's some code to convert [spiral coordinates](https://lib.rs/crates/hex-spiral) for a hexagon grid to [cube coordinates](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/) (q,r,s) and vice versa.

* The main code is written in Rust. Use cargo run, or go check out [hex-spiral](https://github.com/ljedrz/hex-spiral) as this crate now has the same functionality built in.
* spiral_to_cube_demo.ipynb shows some of the maths behind how this is done in a visual way, and how you might go about this in Python.
